# Portfolio

This is a simple Tailwind CSS-based portfolio page. It includes examples of hero, about, projects, design styles (from `AGENTS.md`), and contact sections.

## How to view
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double click or Right-click -> Open With Browser)
- The page uses the Tailwind Play CDN, so an internet connection is required for the styles.

## How to customize
- Replace `Your Name` with your name and update the short bio under the About section.
- Replace project titles, descriptions, badges and links with your actual projects and URLs.
- Replace the placeholder avatar by placing an image in the folder and updating the `svg` placeholder with an `<img>` tag (make sure you keep the `rounded-full` class for styling).
- Customize the "Design Styles" section by editing `AGENTS.md` content or the cards in `index.html`.

## Notes
- This page is a static HTML file using the Tailwind CDN, so no build step is required.
- For production, consider installing Tailwind properly and compiling CSS, or using a static site generator for more features.

Enjoy! 🎉
